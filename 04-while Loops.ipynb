    "Immutable: Once created, you cannot change its start, stop, or step values.\n",
    "Memory Efficient: It always uses the same small amount of memory, whether it represents 10 numbers or 10 billion numbers, because it only stores the three \"recipe\" values: start, stop, and step. \n",

    "Quick Comparison for Clarity\n",
    "Is it an Iterable? Yes. You can loop over it multiple times.\n",
